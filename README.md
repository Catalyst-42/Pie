# Pie
Code that generates digits of π. I don't know, I just felt like writing.

## Decimal version
Implemented script to calculate π in decimal format based on this [paper](http://numbers.computation.free.fr/Constants/Algorithms/nthdecimaldigit.pdf) with [PDC](http://numbers.computation.free.fr/Constants/Algorithms/pidec.cpp) algorithm.

You also can run `pidec.cpp` to generate several digits starting with nth one!

## Hexadecimal version
Implemented script to calculate π in hexadecimal format based on this [paper](https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1997-66-218/S0025-5718-97-00856-9/S0025-5718-97-00856-9.pdf) with [BBP](https://observablehq.com/@rreusser/computing-with-the-bailey-borwein-plouffe-formula) algorithm.
